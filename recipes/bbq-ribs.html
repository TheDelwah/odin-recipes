    <h1>BBQ Ribs</h1>
    <p>
      Homemade rib marinade is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's easier
      than it looks. I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a
      quick dinner the next night. The sauce is much better after it is cooked;
      it is not a dipping sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
      <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup chile sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup rum</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
      <li>1 dash ground black pepper</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double thickness of
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Unwrap and drain drippings.
        (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a
        large roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together brown sugar, chile sauce, ketchup, soy sauce,
        Worcestershire sauce, rum, garlic, mustard, and pepper in a bowl. Coat
        ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or
        refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position grate 4 inches above heat
        source; grease the grate with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>
      You may also bake the ribs for 30 minutes for the final step, basting with
      sauce while they bake.
