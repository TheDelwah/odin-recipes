    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup finely crushed pretzels</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup margarine, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>⅓ cup frozen limeade concentrate, thawed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tequila</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon orange liqueur</li>
      <li>3 drops green food coloring, or as needed (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1 lime, sliced (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix pretzels and sugar together in a bowl; stir in margarine until
        evenly incorporated. Spoon mixture into a 9-inch pie plate; press into
        the bottom and sides of the plate to form a firm, even crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake crust in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about
        5 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix sweetened condensed milk, limeade concentrate, tequila, orange
        liqueur, and green food coloring in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your
        beater or whisk straight up: whipped cream should form soft mounds
        rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into sweetened condensed
        milk mixture. Spoon filling into cooled crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover pie with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Let
        stand for 10 minutes before serving; garnish with lime slices.
      </li>
    </ol>
